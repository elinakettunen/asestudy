# Data

`food-animal-proportion.csv` contains food item codes and Finnish names of all consumed foods and drinks. Most of these food items are listed in the Finnish food composition database Fineli, maintained by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare. 

In this file, the variable animal_proportion equals animal source weight proportion (ASWP), which was estimated/calculated by a researcher. Details of the estimation/calculation are provided in the article.

Due to ethical considerations and privacy regulations, other original data files used in this project are not publicly shared.
